## Task: Mobile CV Application
 Develop and design a mobile application serving as a comprehensive CV, showcasing personal and professional details. The app should enable both viewing and editing of the provided CV information.
Requirements:
### Personal Information: The application should display:
- Your full name
- Slack username
- GitHub handle
- A brief personal bio
### Home/First Page (CV View):
This will be the initial screen users encounter upon opening the app.
It will come pre-filled with your aforementioned details.
Craft this page in a clean and organized manner to present the CV information clearly.
### Editing Capability:
Include a dedicated page or screen for editing the CV particulars.
This editing page should offer user-friendly fields or sections for modifying the existing CV data.
### Real-time Updates:
After making changes to the CV details, returning to the home/first page should immediately reflect the alterations.
Ensure the app updates dynamically without requiring manual refresh.
